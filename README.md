## Why Logus?

In the rapidly evolving field of AI and large language models, crafting effective prompts has become a crucial skill. Logus is born out of the need for a sophisticated, user-friendly tool that empowers developers, researchers, and AI enthusiasts to:

- Analyze and refine prompts in real-time
- Generate and manage test cases
- Execute prompts across multiple AI models
- Visualize and understand prompt effectiveness

Whether you're a seasoned prompt engineer or just starting your journey with AI, Logus provides the tools you need to elevate your prompt crafting skills.

## What is Logus?

Logus is an advanced prompt engineering tool available as:
1. **A Python library** for programmatic use in your applications
2. **A command-line interface** for quick analysis and testing
3. **A web interface** with an intuitive frontend for interactive prompt engineering

Key features include:

- **Real-time Prompt Analysis**: Get instant feedback on your prompts' effectiveness and alignment with your goals.
- **Multi-model Support**: Test your prompts across various AI models, including GPT-4, Claude, and more.
- **Test Case Generation**: Automatically generate relevant test cases for your prompts.
- **Interactive Code Editor**: A feature-rich editor with syntax highlighting and real-time analysis feedback (in web UI).
- **Execution Environment**: Run your prompts and see the results immediately.
- **Test Case Management**: Store and download generated test cases as JSON files (in web UI).
- **Dynamic Goal Inference**: Automatically infer the goal of your prompt if not provided.

## Installation

```bash
pip install logus
```

For web interface support, install with the web extra:
```bash
pip install logus[web]
```

## Usage

### As a Library

```python
from logus.core import LLMModel, analyze_prompt, generate_test

prompt = "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information..."

# Analyze a prompt
analysis = analyze_prompt(prompt, LLMModel.GPT_4)
print(f"Goal alignment: {analysis.overall_goal_alignment}/10")

# Generate a test case
test_case = generate_test(prompt, LLMModel.GPT_4)
```

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Analyze a prompt
logus analyze "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information..."

# Generate a test case
logus test "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information..."

# See all available commands
logus --help
```

### Web Interface

To run the web interface:
```bash
logus-web  # If installed with web extras
# or
python -m logus.web
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## API Keys

Logus requires API keys for the AI models you want to use:

- OpenAI API key for GPT models
- Anthropic API key for Claude models
- Groq API key for Mixtral models

Set these as environment variables:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```
