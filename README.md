## Why Logus?
In the rapidly evolving field of AI and large language models, crafting effective prompts has become a crucial skill. Logus is born out of the need for a sophisticated, user-friendly tool that empowers developers, researchers, and AI enthusiasts to:

Analyze and refine prompts in real-time
Generate and manage test cases
Execute prompts across multiple AI models
Visualize and understand prompt effectiveness

Whether you're a seasoned prompt engineer or just starting your journey with AI, Logus provides the tools you need to elevate your prompt crafting skills.

## What is Logus?

Logus is an advanced prompt engineering tool that combines a powerful backend API with an intuitive React frontend. Key features include:

- **Real-time Prompt Analysis**: Get instant feedback on your prompts' effectiveness and alignment with your goals.
- **Multi-model Support**: Test your prompts across various AI models, including GPT-4, Claude, and more.
- **Test Case Generation**: Automatically generate relevant test cases for your prompts.
- **Interactive Code Editor**: A feature-rich editor with syntax highlighting and real-time analysis feedback.
- **Execution Environment**: Run your prompts and see the results immediately.
- **Markdown-supported Output**: View AI responses with proper formatting for enhanced readability.
- **Theme Customization**: Switch between light and dark themes for comfortable use in any environment.

## How It Works

Logus consists of two main components:

1. **Backend API (Python + FastAPI)**: Handles prompt analysis, test generation, and execution across different AI models.
2. **Frontend Application (React + DaisyUI)**: Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the API and visualizing results.

The application uses a modular architecture, allowing for easy extension and customization of both the backend models and frontend components.
