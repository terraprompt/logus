# Prompt Development Lifecycle

Blogus is designed to support the complete prompt engineering workflow, from initial creation to ongoing optimization.

## 1. Initial Creation

Start with a basic prompt idea:

```bash
# Create a simple prompt
echo "You are a helpful assistant." > my_prompt.txt
```

Or directly work with prompt text in Blogus:

```python
from blogus.core import analyze_prompt, JudgeLLMModel

prompt = "You are a helpful assistant."
analysis = analyze_prompt(prompt, JudgeLLMModel.GPT_4)
```

## 2. Analysis and Evaluation

Use Blogus to analyze your prompt's effectiveness:

```bash
# Analyze with a judge model
blogus analyze "You are a helpful assistant." \
  --judge-model claude-3-opus-20240229
```

This provides:
- Overall goal alignment score
- Effectiveness estimates
- Specific improvement suggestions

## 3. Iterative Enhancement

Based on the analysis, enhance your prompt:

```python
# Get detailed fragment analysis
from blogus.core import analyze_fragments, JudgeLLMModel

prompt = "You are a helpful assistant."
fragments = analyze_fragments(prompt, JudgeLLMModel.GPT_4)

for fragment in fragments:
    print(f"Fragment: {fragment.text}")
    print(f"Alignment: {fragment.goal_alignment}/5")
    print(f"Suggestion: {fragment.improvement_suggestion}")
```

Apply the suggestions to improve your prompt.

## 4. Cross-Model Validation

Test your enhanced prompt across different target models:

```bash
# Test on different models
blogus execute "You are a helpful assistant that provides concise answers." \
  --target-model gpt-4o

blogus execute "You are a helpful assistant that provides concise answers." \
  --target-model claude-3-haiku-20240307
```

Compare results to ensure consistent performance.

## 5. Test Dataset Generation

Generate test cases to validate prompt performance:

```bash
# Generate test cases
blogus test "Translate English to French: {text}" \
  --judge-model claude-3-opus-20240229
```

This creates structured test cases with:
- Input variables and values
- Expected outputs
- Goal relevance scores

## 6. Performance Monitoring

Continuously monitor prompt performance:

```python
from blogus.core import analyze_logs, JudgeLLMModel

prompt = "Enhanced prompt text here"
logs = analyze_logs(prompt, JudgeLLMModel.GPT_4)

for log in logs:
    print(f"[{log.type.upper()}] {log.message}")
```

## 7. Version Control and Experimentation

Blogus integrates well with version control systems:

```bash
# Track prompt versions
git add prompts/
git commit -m "Update customer service prompt with new guidelines"
```

Use branches for experimentation:

```bash
# Create experiment branch
git checkout -b prompt-experiment-001

# Implement changes
# ... modify prompts ...

# Compare results
git diff main -- prompts/
```

## 8. Collaboration and Sharing

Share prompt engineering work with your team:

```bash
# Export analysis results
blogus analyze "Your prompt here" \
  --judge-model gpt-4o \
  --output-format json > prompt_analysis.json
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic prompts and enhance iteratively
2. **Use Capable Judges**: Choose powerful models for analysis even if they're expensive
3. **Test Broadly**: Validate prompts across multiple target models
4. **Generate Tests**: Create test cases for critical prompts
5. **Monitor Continuously**: Regularly check prompt performance
6. **Document Changes**: Keep records of prompt evolution
7. **Collaborate**: Share insights and improvements with your team

By following this lifecycle, you can systematically improve your prompts and maintain high-quality AI interactions.
